# Simple Java Calculator App
I want to start improving my Java skills. I am starting small, working and understanding the syntax and how the lanaguage works. 
This app is pretty small in scope, and goes over concepts I have a firm grasp in and could easily implement in a language that I am more comfortable in.

### Future Work
Introduce more complex arithmetic, maybe some algebraic concepts.
